Cypress Work Week 1 contains:
  Most of the work compelted in week 1.
  The remaining work I competed in week 1 is under week2.
  
Cypress Work Week 2 contains:
  All of the work compelted in week 2.
  A small amount of work completed in week 1.
  The reason for this crossover between weeks is because I started a new project at the end of week 1, completed 3 automations in it, and then continued to fill it out throughout week 2
